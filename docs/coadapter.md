We introduce **CoAdapter** (**Co**mposable **Adapter**) by jointly training T2I-Adapters and an extra fuser. The fuser allows different adapters with various conditions to be aware of each other and synergize to achieve more powerful composability, especially the combination of elemental style and other structural information.
